# Pay with Stellar!

This project marks my initial exploration of the Stellar blockchain, developed during the RiseIn Stellar Fullstack Bootcamp. It showcases a decentralized application (dApp) that interacts with the Stellar blockchain, with key features including integration with the Freighter wallet for seamless wallet connection and the ability to send XLM transactions. Built using React, the project leverages Stellar's JavaScript SDK to enable efficient blockchain interactions.


## Features

- **Wallet Integration**: Connect your Freighter wallet to the dApp to manage and interact with your Stellar account.
- **XLM Transfer**: Send XLM to any Stellar address with an optional message, using a simple and user-friendly interface.
- **Responsive UI**: Optimized design that adapts to various screen sizes, offering a consistent experience across devices.
- **Stellar SDK Integration**: Powered by Stellar's official JavaScript SDK for transaction management and account handling.


## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **Stellar JavaScript SDK**: For interacting with the Stellar blockchain.
- **Freighter**: Browser extension wallet for Stellar.
- **CSS3**: Used for styling the application interface.
